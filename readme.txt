Unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish the assignment on time.

Question #1:
   - I was able to run the first test(look for the end states)
   - I was able to run the second test part 1(look for an e move to a different state)
   - Unfortunately, I could not figure the recursion out

Question #2:
   - Here I was struggling because the majority of the time I tried to focus on the first part1
   - Once again, the recursion is what I could not figure it out
